What is version controllig?
Version control, also known as source control or revision control,
 is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall
 specific versions later. It's commonly used in software development but can also be applied to other types of files such as documents, configuration files, and graphics.

Why it's needed?
Tracking Changes: Version control allows you to track changes made to files, including who made the changes and when they were made.
Collaboration: It facilitates collaboration among team members by providing a centralized repository where everyone can access and contribute to the project.
Revert to Previous Versions: It enables you to revert to previous versions of files if something goes wrong or if you need to roll back to a stable state.
Branching and Merging: Version control systems allow for branching, which enables developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other. Merging branches back into the main codebase is also simplified.
Backup: It serves as a backup mechanism, ensuring that your project's history and code are not lost even if your local machine fails.

3:
Different Version Control Systems:
Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): These systems have a central server that stores all the files and their versions. Examples include CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and Subversion (SVN).
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): In DVCS, each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its full history. Examples include Git and Mercurial.

4:
Most popular version control systems:
Git: Git is by far the most popular version control system, known for its speed, distributed nature, and robust branching and merging capabilities.
Subversion (SVN): SVN is a centralized version control system known for its simplicity and ease of use, especially for users transitioning from older systems like CVS.
Mercurial: Mercurial is another distributed version control system that's similar to Git in many ways but has a slightly different workflow and command set.
Benefits of using version control:
History Tracking: Easily track changes made to files over time.
Collaboration: Enable multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
Backup and Restore: Maintain a backup of project history and easily revert to previous versions if needed.
Branching and Merging: Facilitate parallel development by creating branches for features or bug fixes and merging them back into the main codebase.
Conflict Resolution: Detect and resolve conflicts that arise when multiple users modify the same file concurrently.
Code Reviews: Facilitate code reviews by providing a centralized location for reviewing changes before they are merged into the main codebase.
Overall, version control systems are essential tools for managing and maintaining the integrity of software projects, enabling collaboration, and ensuring the reliability of codebases.
